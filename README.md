## Learning Path

Learning paths are a sequence of courses that guide you through the training materials for a specific InterSystems product or technology. They are designed to be taken in the order presented, as each subsequent course will build on knowledge from previous courses. Learning paths are a great way to learn a new technology or product from scratch, or to brush up on a topic you already know.
